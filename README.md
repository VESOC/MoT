# Mail of Today

***Mail of Today*** is a automated mailing program that sends weather and news data.

Base program only supports gmail but you can easily change the mail server on line 23 on MoT.py

info.py.example should be renamed to be info.py and have your email/password information.

Example info.py
```{python}
EMAIL_ADDRESS='example@exmaple.com'
EMAIL_PASSWORD='myemailpassword'
```
